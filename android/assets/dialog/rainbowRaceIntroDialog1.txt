[Spike0] "Rainbow Dash! Am I glad to see you. I'm going around town earning bits -"
[Rainbowdash0] "That's nice Spike. You selling filly-scout cookies? I like the peanut butter kind."
[Spike1] "What? No. I'm going around helping ponies out. You know?"
[Rainbowdash1] "So...no cookies?"
[Spike2] "No but -"
[Rainbowdash2] "You sure?"
[Spike3] "NO!"
[Rainbowdash3] "..."
[Spike4] "Look Rainbow Dash. I'm here to help you out with whatever you need. Like maybe preparing for the party tonight?"
[Rainbowdash4] "Uh...that's real sweet Spike, but I got it covered. I've just been hanging today, after all I can clear the sky in like... 10 seceonds flat."
[Spike5] "There's got to be something!"
[Rainbowdash5] "Well, I was thinking about taking Tank to Fluttershy's. He's been acting kind of down. I'm want to make sure he's not sick."
[Spike6] "I can do that!"
[Rainbowdash6] "All right, be careful Spike."
