[AppleBloom0] "Hey Spike, whatcha doing with Tank?"
[Spike0] "Trying to figure out how to make him fast, he so can race Rainbow Dash. Not alot of luck just yet."
[Scootaloo0] "Oh yeah! That would be awesome!"
[SweetieBell0] "But also kind of impossible. I mean, he's not exactly built for speed."
[Scootaloo2] "Hey! What kind of attitude is that? He hasn't got wings either but he CAN fly."
[SweetieBell2] "Well, yeah but that's because he's got that spinning fan thing."
[AppleBloom2] "Maybe Tank just needs an upgrade. What do you think crusaders? Want to try getting our cutie marks in mechanical engineering?"
[SweetieBell3] "Sure, how hard could it be?"
[Scootaloo3] "Aww yeah!"
[Spike2] "You fillies are great!"
[All] "Cutie Mark Crusaders go!"
(Screen blacks out and comes back)
[AppleBloom3] "All finished and trust us, Tank's gonna be real speedy now."
[Scootaloo4] "We tinkered with the motor a bit, and added a remote so you control him from the ground."
[SweetieBell4] "It's amazing what you can learn from PonyTube."
[Scootaloo5] "Yep, and don't worry we worked all the bugs out. I think..."
[Spike3] "But no cutie marks huh?"
[AppleBloom4] "No, but that's all right. We're always happy to help out a friend. Good luck out there you two!"
