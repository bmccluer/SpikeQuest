"Oh I see. That telescope!"

[Spike0]
"What - what am I gonna do now?"

[Pinkie1]
"Well that one looks a little broken. Why don’t you buy a new one? I saw one in (whatever 	store) that looks just like it"

[Spike1]
"Yeah, maybe I could do that. If it looks just like it then she won't even 	know. That's a great idea!"

[Pinkie2]
"Yep! All you need is (x) amount of bits! Easy peasey."

[Spike2]
"(x) bits! Where am I supposed to get that kind of money?"

[Pinkie3]
"Well you just tell Twilight you broke the telescope. After all, she just trusted you with her allllllllllll time favorite possession. Accidents happen you know."

[Spike3]
"No please Pinkie Pie, you gotta help me!"

[Pinkie4]
"Hmmm, welllllll you could help me clean up for a party. I could pay you bits for it."

[Spike4]
"I can do that! Just tell me what to do!"
