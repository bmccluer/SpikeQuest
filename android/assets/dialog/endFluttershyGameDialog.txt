"You can stop...um...looking now Spike. All of them are here now...so... I wanted to say...thanks."

{yay,0.5}
"Yay!"

[Spike1]
"Oh great..."

[Fluttershy2]
"I really can't tell you have relieved I am. I was so worried, I thought maybe something awful had happened...But now, we can start practicing at last."

[Spike2]
"Yeah, but what am I supposed to do?"

[Fluttershy3]
"Oh...well...I don't know..."

[Spike3]
"I was afraid of that."

[Fluttershy4]
"...Oh! Maybe Rainbow Dash needs help. I'm sure she'd be very appreciative."

[Spike4]
"Okay. It's worth a try anyway. Thanks Fluttershy!"

[Fluttershy5]
"You're welcome...and uh...Spike?"

[Spike5]
"Yes?"

[Fluttershy6]
"Good luck."
