"I'm so excited about tonight Spike! A new comet is passing overhead Equestria tonight and it is going to be spectacular. If calculations are correct, we may not see one as big and bright in our entire lifetimes! With everypony going to Lookout Point, I just know tonight is going to be special. The kind of night that you always remember!" 

[Spike0]
"You bet Twilight!"

[Twilight1]
"Of course, everything has to be absolutely perfect. I've organized everything. Apple Jack will provide the food, and Rainbow Dash has agreed to clear the skies. Rarity is putting up the decorations. Fluttershy has musical entertainment for us. Pinkie Pie is of course in charge of the party as a whole… That’s everything, isn't it?"

[Spike1]
"Sure is!"

[Twilight2]
"Oh wait! I forgot about the telescope! I promised everypony we could use it tonight! Quick, Spike pack it up and take down to Pinkie Pie. I want to be sure everything is ready to go for tonight. I'm sure she's already started preparations."

[Spike2]
"You can count on me Twilight!"

[Twilight3]
"Just be careful, Spike. The telescope is fragile. I wouldn't want anything to happen to it."

[Spike3]
"Don't worry Twilight. You know you can count on your #1 assistant to get the job done right."

[Twilight4]
"You're right Spike. I know the telescope will be in good hands. Once you're done you can take the rest of the day off. You’ve earned it."
